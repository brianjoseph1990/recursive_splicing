This repository is designed to store scripts and additional analyses that are linked to the recursive splicing paper Sibley et al.


# Sequence data

The RNASeq data that have been used for this work have been deposited in the SRA (BAM format).
The relevant accession ID can be found in the file
support/sample_accessions_ukbec.xlsx

# figure_scripts

The scripts used to generated figures are store in the folder
figure_scripts

Running
sh figure_scripts/make_figures.sh

should create the figures used in the paper (placed in the folder fig)


# seesaw pattern analysis

The RNASeq analysis for that specific seesaw pattern is somewhat complex, and can the relevant scripts can be found in this folder
seesaw_pattern_detection/

This is still a work in progress and some example scripts will be placed there in the near future.
